The user’s visit history below is delimited by three backticks.
Your goal is to extract user preferences from the given visit history. 
The extracted user's preferences will be used in the task of recommending the user's next visit.

When extracting user preferences, consider the following to capture multidimensional preferences:
1.Temporal Patterns: Include daily, weekly, and monthly patterns in visit history, as well as any anomalies, to infer preferences.
2.Geographic Preferences: Analyze visitation patterns to identify any geographical preferences.
3.Individual Characteristics: Deduce individual characteristics from visitation patterns and incorporate these insights into preference.

Look into the features of the user’s visit history and put emphasis on key features of the data that could be useful in extracting user preferences.
